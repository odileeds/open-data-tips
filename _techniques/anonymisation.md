title: Anonymisation
---

Anonymisation is the process of removing personal identifiers, both direct and indirect, that may 
lead to an individual being identified.

While this seems an easy task, the presence of reidentification / jigsaw attacks means that much
more data needs to be removed, or records redacted to fulfil the needs of GDPR.
