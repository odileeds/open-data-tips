title: Delayed Publication
common: true
---

Deferring publication of data for a defined period.

When data has a limited time sensitivity, for example location data (to understand traffic behaviour say) being made immediately public would not be appropriate as it could be used to track someone in real time and perhaps identify the individual. 

However, releasing this data at a later point can not only reduce this risk but further data manipulations can be applied to make the data even more secure (such as removing potential home and work identifiers of an individual, see Section on Translation/Rotation).
